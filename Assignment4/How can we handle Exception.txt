Two things will happen when Exception occours
 
	1.User will suggest to handle the exception using Try-Catch blocks.
		Put the code you want to run in the try block, and any 
		Exceptions that the code throws are caught by one or more catch blocks,
		This method will catch any type of Java exceptions that get thrown. 

		Case 1.
		try {
 		      //block of code that can throw exceptions
		 } catch (Exception ex) {
  		     //Exception handler
		 }


		case 2.
		try {
		  //block of code that can throw exceptions
			} catch (ExceptionType1 ex1) {
  				// exception handler for ExceptionType1
		} catch (ExceptionType2 ex2) {
 			 // Exception handler for ExceptionType2
		}
		In case 2
		-A try block can be followed by one or more catch blocks, each
		 specifying a different type.
		-The first catch block that handles the exception class or one 
		 of its superclasses will be executed. So, make sure to catch the
		 most specific class first.
		-If an exception occurs in the try block, the exception is thrown 
		 to the first catch block. If not, the Java exception passes down 
		 to the second catch statement. This continues until the exception
		 either is caught or falls through all catches.



	2.Unable to handle exception use throwable<class> Exception.

		-Using Throwable class, you can also create your own custom exceptions.

		if(age < 18){
			throw new ArthematicException("Person is not aeligible to vote");
		}else{
			system.out.println("Person is eligible to vote");
		}
