Exception handling ensures that the flow of the program doesn’t break when an exception occurs. 
For example, if a program has bunch of statements and an exception occurs mid way after executing 
certain statements then the statements after the exception will not execute and the program will terminate abruptly.
ie,. program has 10 lines of code ,at line 5 there is an exception , by which lines 5 6 7 8 9 10 wiil not execute.
By handling we make sure that all the statements execute and the flow of program doesn’t break.
