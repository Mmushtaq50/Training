1.@Transient annotation in JPA or Hibernate is used to indicate that a field is not to
  be persisted or ignore fields to save in the database.

  -used to mark a field to be transient for the mapping framework, which means the
    field marked with @Transient is ignored by mapping framework and the field not
     mapped to any database column (in RDBMS) or Document property (in NOSQL). 

2.@Transient exist in javax. persistence package. 
   It is used to annotate a property or field of an entity class, mapped superclass, or embeddable class.

3.transient is a variables modifier used in serialization. 
  At the time of serialization, if we don't want to save value of a particular variable in a 
  file, then we use transient keyword. When JVM comes across transient keyword, it ignores 
   original value of the variable and save default value of that variable data type


	
	Note: Persistent means that the object has been saved to the database 
	       whereas transient means that it hasn't been saved yet.
