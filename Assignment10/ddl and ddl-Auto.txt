JPA has features for DDL generation, and these can be set up
  to run on startup against the database. This is controlled through two external properties:

   spring.jpa.generate-ddl (boolean) switches the feature on and off and is vendor independent.






   spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto (enum) is a Hibernate feature that controls the behavior in a more fine-grained way.
	-You can set spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto explicitly and the 
	  standard Hibernate property values are none, validate, update, create-drop
