Response Body :

		@ResponseBody is an annotation, indicates that the return value 
		 of a method will be serialized into the body of the HTTP response.	
	
		1.Basicall we are checking response body
 		   to verify if request matches with response.
		2.In the response we are verifying
		   (body, status code, header, response time,
		   test structure of json against the given jsonSchema)

	3.The REST API sends a response header and response body in JSON format
	  with information about the success or failure of the REST API call.
	
	4.The response header can contain the following information:
		server
		content-type
		content-language
		content-length
		date
		connection
		transfer-encoding
		severity
		errorCode
		description
		logFile

	5.The response body can contain information about the output and additional output ports.
	 - If the output type was file, the response body contains a path to the output.
	 - If the output type was buffer, the response body contains the buffer contents. 
	  -The response body can also contain a success or failure code and message

	
	Response Entity:
		
		1.ResponseEntity represents the whole HTTP response: status code, headers, and body.
		- As a result, we can use it to fully configure the HTTP response.
	
		2.ResponseEntity<> is a generic class with a type parameter, you can 
		  specify what type of object to be serialized into the response body.

		3.If we want to use it, we have to return it from the endpoint

		4.ResponseEntity provides two nested builder interfaces: HeadersBuilder and
		  its subinterface, BodyBuilder. Therefore, we can access their capabilities through the static methods of ResponseEntity
