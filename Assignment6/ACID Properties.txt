JDBC Transaction ACID Property:

	A Transaction is a unit of work performed on the database and treated in a
		reliable way independent of other transaction.

	In database transaction processing ACID property refers to the
		 Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability respectively.

	Atomicity- This property says that all the changes to the data is performed if 
		   they are single operation. For example suppose in a bank application if 
		   a fund transfer from one account to another account the atomicity property 
		   ensures that is a debit is made successfully in one account the corresponding
		   credit would be made in other account.

	Consistency- The consistency property of transaction says that the data remains in the 
		     consistence state when the transaction starts and ends. for example suppose in 
		     the same bank account, the fund transfer from one account to another account, the
		     consistency property ensures that the total value(sum of both account ) value 
		     remains the same after the transaction ends.

	Isolation- This property says that, the intermediate state of transaction are hidden/ invisible to
		   another transaction process. Suppose in the the bank application, the isolation  property
		   ensures that the fund transfer  from one account to another account, the transaction sees 
	           the fund transfer in one account or the other account.

	Durability- The Durability says that when the transaction is completed successfully, the changing
		    to the data is persist and is not un-done, even in the event of system failure.
