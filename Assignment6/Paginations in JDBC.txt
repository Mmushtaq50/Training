Pagination in JDBC:	

	-The method of distributing a single list into multiple pages is known as Pagination.
 	 Paging refers to showing your query result on multiple pages instead of a single page

	-Pagination is a technique for splitting a list of multiple records into sublists.
	 For example, you search with a keyword on Google and receives tens of thousands of results. 
	 However, every Google page displays only 10 results for you. Other results will show on next pages.

	Using OFFSET and LIMIT is the easy way to write pagination into database queries. 

	Pagination is a common application job and its implementation has a major 
	impact on the customer experience.
