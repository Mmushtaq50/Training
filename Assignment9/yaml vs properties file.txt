 yaml : .yml File

	1.YAML is a configuration language like Python, Ruby and Java.
	2.java heavily use (.yml File) for configuring the various properties while developing the applications.
	3.Supports key/val, basically map, List and scalar types (int, string etc.) 
	4.Spring Framework doesn’t support @PropertySources with .yml files	
	5.If you are using spring profiles, you can have multiple profiles in one single .yml file
	6.While retrieving the values from .yml file we get the value as whatever
	  the respective type (int, string etc.) is in the configuration



	

 properties file: (.properties File)
	
	1.This file extension is used for the configuration application. 
	2.These are used as the Property Resource Bundles files in technologies like Java, etc. 
	3.Supports key/val, but doesn’t support values beyond the string
	4.supports @PropertySources with .properties file
	5.Each profile need one separate .properties file
	6.While retrieving the values from .properties files we get strings regardless of what the actual value type is in the configuration


NOTE: .yml file is advantageous over .properties file as it has type safety, hierarchy
	 and supports list but if you are using spring, spring has a number of conventions
	 as well as type conversions that allow you to get effectively all of these
	 same features that YAML provides for you. 
	
	One advantage that you may see is, out of using the YAML(.yml) file is if you
	 are using more than one application that read the same configuration file. 
	you may see better support in other languages for YAML(.yml) as opposed to .properties.
