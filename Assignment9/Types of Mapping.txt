@RequestMapping:
	
	1.maps HTTP requests (URLs) with methods:

		@RequestMapping("/")
		public void helloWorld() {
   			 return "Hello World!";
		}
	2.It allows us to run methods and pieces of code each 
	 time an endpoint is hit by the end-user with an HTTP request.

	3.several new annotations, the @RequestMapping variants:

		@GetMapping   :  GetMapping Annotation is for mapping HTTP GET requests onto specific handler methods
		@PostMapping  :  maps HTTP POST requests onto specific handler methods. @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod. POST)
		@DeleteMapping:  maps HTTP DELETE requests onto specific handler methods. @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod. DELETE) 
		@PatchMapping :  for mapping HTTP PATCH requests onto specific handler methods @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod. PATCH) .
