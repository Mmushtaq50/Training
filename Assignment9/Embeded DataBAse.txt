Embeded DataBase:

	 Ease of configuration, quick startup time, testability, and the ability to rapidly
	  evolve SQL during development are just some of the benefits of using an embedded database.

	-There is a special file called application.properties in Spring Boot, where you can 
	  define your authorization data to get connection with your remote database.

Internal database	:
		Maven willl take care of injecting all Depedencies 
	
external database	
	The external database is a sample and includes an id , username and data
	 it allows us to keep compile-time and run-time configuration settings nicely separated from each other.
