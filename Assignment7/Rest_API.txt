Rest_API: (Representational State Transfer _ Application Program Interface)
		
	A REST API (Aka RESTful API) is an application programming interface (API or web API)
	 that allows for interaction with RESTful web services and conforms to the constraints of REST architectural style . 

		So there is an Rest API(Somthing that will connect the client with the server)by using servlets or by
		  genertating the servlet 
  
				Servlets is a javaSide component that will accept the HTTP servlet Request
 				 and generate HTTP servlet Response. (HTTP = WebPages)

	Example: 
		-Imagine you want to create a weather report App,(Inorder to do that we need some
		   data about at which place the weather report it,like weather report in US exapmle)

		 -So there are some Web services available on internet who are ready to give you that data Resources
		  All you need to do is call  and connect them 

		-So there is an Rest API(Somthing that will connect the client with the server)so by
		  genertating the servlet  
					Servlets is a javaSide component that will accept the HTTP servlet Request
 					 and generate HTTP servlet Response. (HTTP = WebPages)

		-But the problem arises here, which is, the client dont want the response in HTTP(Web pages) instead he
		  need the response in the form of data  (Example : data about weather report)
		
		-So client will say to servlet i dont want webPage i need data Resource
	           ,Servlet will say ok i can give you the data in two formates either by 
		    JSON or  XML (which will send the state of an object but not an object)

		-That why it is called Rest_API(rest:representational state transfer) Rest_API
		now that state of an object can be send using JSON oe XMl
	
		-By doing this, client is gettig Data resource  in the from servlet via: JSON / XML 
			do we user CURD operation or HTTP methods in order to manipulate with data resource

		-when it comes to Cimate report APP ,dosent matter which APP/wesite you are creating or what requirment we have 
		 we do one simple thing ie: we do CURD operations
						   -we create the resource
						   -we read the resource
						   -we update the resource
						   -we delete the resource

		-so instead of using the CURD operations, we also have HTTP methods
								- PUT  method
								- POST method 
								- PULL method
								- DELETE method

Note: 1.Before json developers used to work on XML(like when you want to send data from server to client) 
	 ,infact still some of them use XML, but then json is trying to overide the XMl features so it has become a standered format.

	JSON:
		{"country";{
			"city";{
			 "temp":33,
			 "humidity":40
				}
			}

	XML:
		<country>
			<city>
				<temp>33</temp>
				<humidity>40</humidity>
			</city>
		</country>
		

      2.In javaScript we create an array Object which is basically an JSON Object.

      3.Rest_Api can be implemented by two famous ways
