JSP : (Servlet + Html)
      JSP is a webSide componet which will be the combination 
	on Servlet and HTML
 
//implicit objects - out, response, session, application, page, request

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Servlet:
	Servlets is a javaSide component that will accept the HTTp servlet Request
 	and generate HTTP servlet Response.

	-when client send the request ,there should be someone who shlould send the response : by servlet
	-Inorder to get our our HTTP servlet Response, we must need a class and we should extend our class with HTTPServlet,
		but in case of Rest_Api this is not reqired 

servlet lifeCyce:
		  1.init  
		  2.doGet,doPost or service
		  3.destroy



How do you call a servlet?
	servlets are configured in web.Xml (Deployment Descriptor) where we do mapping
	for the respective servlet to be uniquely identified by a url patterns.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the use of Web.Xml?
	1.web.xml defines mappings between URL paths and the servlets that handle requests with
	 those paths. 

	2.The web server uses this configuration to identify the servlet to handle 
	 a given request and call the class method that corresponds to the 
	 request method (e.g. the doGet() method for HTTP GET requests).

	3.It contains all resources needed to run the application, from Java classes, to JAR files
	 and libraries, to other supporting files that the developer does not want a web user to access.

	4.web.xml :1.Helps in providing the Dependencies(like WebApp Apis)
		 2.Helps in providing the plugins (plugins inorder to run and compile the webApp application)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


How many types of servlets are there?
		     Two types of servlets -
			Generic and HTTP
	   Generic						HTTP
	1.extends GenericServlet				1.extends HTTPServlet
	2.doPost						2.getPost


what are all methods available in servlets


synchronus: 
	1.Submit a request to server and waiting for the response
	(A synchronous client constructs an HTTP structure, sends a request, and waits for a response.)

Asynchronus:
	2.submit request in background and process with other Tasks.
	(An asynchronous client constructs an HTTP structure, sends a request, and moves on.)

AJAX -Asynchronus JavaScript using XML

Rest_API:

		So there is an Rest API(Somthing that will connect the client with the server)so by
		  genertating the servlet  
					Servlets is a javaSide component that will accept the HTTP servlet Request
 					 and generate HTTP servlet Response. (HTTP = WebPages)

	Example: 
		-Imagine you want to create a weather report App,(Inorder to do that we need some
		   data about at which place the weather report it,like weather report in US exapmle)

		 -So there are some Web services available on internet who are ready to give you that data Resources
		  All you need to do is call  and connect them 

		-So there is an Rest API(Somthing that will connect the client with the server)so by
		  genertating the servlet  
					Servlets is a javaSide component that will accept the HTTP servlet Request
 					 and generate HTTP servlet Response. (HTTP = WebPages)

		-But the problem arises here, which is, the client dont want the response in HTTP(Web pages) instead he
		  need the response in the form of data  (Example : data about weather report)
		
		-So client will say to servlet i dont want webPage i need data Resource
	           ,Servlet will say ok i can give you the data in two formates either by 
		    JSON or  XML (which will send the state of an object but not an object)

		-That why it is called Rest_API(rest:representational state transfer) Rest_API
		now that state of an object can be send using JSON oe XMl
	
		-By doing this, client is gettig Data resource  in the from servlet via: JSON / XML 
			do we user CURD operation or HTTP methods in order to manipulate with data resource

		-when it comes to Cimate report APP ,dosent matter which APP/wesite you are creating or what requirment we have 
		 we do one simple thing ie: we do CURD operations
						   -we create the resource
						   -we read the resource
						   -we update the resource
						   -we delete the resource

		-so instead of using the CURD operations, we also have HTTP methods
								- PUT  method
								- POST method 
								- PULL method
								- DELETE method

Note: 1.Before json developers used to work on XML(like when you want to send data from server to client) 
	 ,infact still some of them use XML, but then json is trying to overide the XMl features so it has become a standered format.

	JSON:
		{"country";{
			"city";{
			 "temp":33,
			 "humidity":40
				}
			}

	XML:
		<country>
			<city>
				<temp>33</temp>
				<humidity>40</humidity>
			</city>
		</country>
		

      2.In javaScript we create an array Object which is basically an JSON Object.
