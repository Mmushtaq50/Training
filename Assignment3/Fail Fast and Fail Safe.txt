 Fail Fast and Fail Safe:

  1. Fail Fast and Fail Safe are two types of iterators which
	Java Collection supports.	
  2. These iterators are very useful in exception handling.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Fail fast iterator =

	-- Aborts the operation as soon it 
       	   exposes failures and stops the entire operation

	-- The Fail Fast system is a system that shuts down 
	   immediately after an error is reported. All the 
	   operations will be aborted instantly in it.

	-- They are memory savers, don't require extra memory.

	-- The Fail Fast iterator uses an internal flag called
	   modCount to know the status of the collection.
	 
	-- The modCount flag is updated each time a collection is
	   modified; 
	   it checks the next value; 
	   if it finds, then the modCount will be modified after 
	   this iterator has been created. It will 
	   throw ConcurrentModificationException. if a collection
	   is modified while iterating over it.

	-- uses an original collection to traverse over the 
	   collection's elements.
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Fail Safe iterator =

	-- doesn't Abort the operation in 
	   case of a failure.

	-- The Fail Safe is a system that continues to operate 
	   even after an error or fail has occurred. These systems  
	   do not abort the operations instantly; instead, they
	   will try to hide the errors and will try to avoid failures 
	   as much as possible.

	-- We can perform the modification operations on a collection 
	   while iterating over it.

	-- they will not throw ConcurrentModificationException during the iteration

	-- It use a copy of the collection to traverse over the elements.

	-- they require more memory as they cloned the collection.
	
	-- The examples of Fail Safe iterators are ConcurrentHashMap, 
		CopyOnWriteArrayList, etc.
