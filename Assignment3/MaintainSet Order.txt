Maintain an order in set?
	
	1. LinkedHashSet can retain the order of the collection.
	   you can wrap your set using this implementation.
	2. SortedSet implementation can be used for sorted order

		Set myOrderedSet = new LinkedHashSet(mySet);

	keep the insertion order: LinkedHashSet and CopyOnWriteArraySet
	 (thread-safe)
	keep the items sorted within the set: TreeSet, EnumSet 
	(specific to enums) and ConcurrentSkipListSet 
	(thread-safe)
	does not keep the items in any specific order: HashSet (the one you tried)
	 
	-you can either sort the items first and then use any (LinkedHashSet or TreeSet).
	-Or alternatively and more efficiently, you can just add unsorted data to a 
	TreeSet which will take care of the sorting automatically.
