HashCode:

	 -Hashcode plays the vital role in HashMap.
		Helps in identify which bucket it should add or place
		and also helps in retriving the object from HashMap.
		--Hashcode will fetch the Unique value in Bucket,
		  by which we can get distinct value such that
		  HashMap is placed.
		  Can also achive the object retriving at better 
		  performance.

	
	 -Equal() Method also will play the vital role in HashMap.
		When two or more Keys are having the same has code
		then equal() will rescue to identify, which key 
		it actually wanted to fetch while getting the value and 
		while storing into the HashMap.
