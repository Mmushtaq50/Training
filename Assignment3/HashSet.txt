HashSet : 
	1.It is a special Collection that contains Unique Elements 
	  and doesnot allow Duplication.
	2.HashSet extends AbstractSet and implements the set in Interface.
	3.HashSet allows only one null value.
	4.It uses Hash Table to store data internallyand works on a 
	 hashing principal.
	5.HashSet only store the elements and not the key values 
	  pairs like HashMap.
	6.HashSet internally uses HashMap for storing the values
		-Whenever the object is created for HashSet it internally creats
	  	the object of HashMap.
		-Beacuse in HashMap each key is Unique. 
				public HashSet{
					map = new HashMap<>();
				  }

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        How the elements are added in the HashSet?
	
	 In HashSet , from Add() method the put() from HashMap is called, where 
		the value which has to be added in the set becomes Key and constant
		objects
		-PRESENT is used as a value.
	
	PRESENT?
	    In HashSet PRESENT implementation is defined as 
		private static void final object PRESENT = new Object();

	
	 Add() method implementation?
		public boolean Add(E e){
			returnMap.put(E,PRESENT)==null;
		}

	so here if you notice that, The add() method of HashSet
	calls put() method of backing HashMap object.

	-It passes the element as the key and a constant  present is
	  stored at its value.
