IoC : Inversion of Control

	1.Spring IoC Container is the core of Spring Framework. 

	  -It creates the Objects, configures and assembles and inject their 
	   dependencies, manages their entire life cycle.

	2.It gets the information about the objects from a configuration file(XML) or java Annotations and
		these objects are called Beans.

	3.The Spring IoC container uses the dependency Injection (DI) to manage the components 
	  and make up the application.

	

	4.In general IoC containers are of 2 types
	    a)BeanFactory container(old)       	 && Will not support Annotations		
	    b)ApplicationContext container(New)  && supports Annotations.

Dependency Injection:

	1.when two class are tightly coupled ,then dont create instance of child class 
	  inside parent , instead the IOC container will take care of object craetion and do setting via 
	  constructor injection or setter injection.

	2.Dependency injection is basically providing the objects that an object needs 
	  (its dependencies) instead of having it construct them itself. 
	
		- dependency injection is a technique in which an object receives other objects that it depends on.
		- Typically, the receiving object is called a client and the passed-in object is called a service. 
		- The code that passes the service to the client is called the injector.
