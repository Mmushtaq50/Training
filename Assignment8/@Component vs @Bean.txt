@Component:

	1.If any class is annotated with @Component it will be automatically detect by using classpath scan.
	2.We can’t create bean if class is outside spring container.
	3.It is a class level annotation.
	4.It works without @Configuration annotation
	5.We can’t write specific implementation based on dynamic condition.
		
		@Component
		public class Pizza{
		}
	
@Bean :
	1.It is explicitly declared as a single bean, rather than letting Spring do it automatically.
	2.Bean can be created even class is outside the spring container
	3.It is a method level annotation
	4.It works only when class is also annotated with @Configuration
	5.We should use @bean, if you want specific implementation based on dynamic condition.
		
		@Configuration
		class AppConfiguration{

   		@Bean
   		public User getUse(){
      		return new User();
   			}
		}
